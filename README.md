## Future Development

#### Login Security

Any future future team working building on this code base will need to implement OAuth authorization and will need to configure security around logins and user-profile for Business Owners, that restricts their edit access to their business page.

#### Data Quality

Any future development team will need to conduct an audit of the data periodically and will need the appropriate fields on the business page to be appropriately populated such as making Business-Website page, Description and Location as required fields in order to be hosted on the website.

#### User Reviews

Any future development team will need to develop and simplify the UI for leaving reviews on the business page. We recommend implementing a 5-Star rating systems with a description field, as this will conform to the standards we have implemented for front for our UI. We recommend that the developers leverage the Handelbars framework to achieve scale and effeciency.

#### Search Optimization

Any future development team will need to work on optimizing the search results that we receive from our database, specially when searching for All Local Businesses, we believe this will become increasingly important as the business database hosts an increasing amount of data in the future.
